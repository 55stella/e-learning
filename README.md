# e-learning platform
Its a new project, all about an e-learning platform.
 I created a database model for subjects, courses, content and module
 The course table has a foreignkey relationship with the module which was merged in the database using the  Django stackedinline class. enabling users to register their courses with modules inclusive.
instructors can register, login, create courses which is a conglomeraton of different modules
instructors are also able to upload different type of contents like videos, texts, images.
i achieved number (4) above using an abstract model
